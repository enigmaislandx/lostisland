        "description": "Once upon a time, there were two exploration teams that were enemy to each other. Never liked each other, always challenged each other, anything you can name in terms of rivalry between these two teams. But they are very loyal to their job: exploring sites, especially things like uncharted island.       So there they were, at a time, being sent out to explore a new, uncharted island that surfaced like never before. No one knows what's inside, no one have idea about what will they stumbled upon, and no one knows the exact situation there. It's like walking on egg shells. As usual, they challenged each other to finish charting the island first before they begin the exploration. That island surfaced on purpose: to challenge all the newcomers to a set of mini games. Two little, naughty, creatures were sent out to announce the challenge to both of those team's leaders. Nope, this wasn't the fair challenge that you think they will be. This, will be the dirty, full of foul challenges created by masterminds who inhabited the island since a long time ago. No particular reason, they just like to trick others into their dirty games. "I challenge you, you piece of sheet, to a game to prove who is the better exploration team!" Shouted by that two creatures at different places, but at the same time. (Notes: to keep things PG-13) The two leaders were furious, as they immediately accepted the challenge, "BRING IT ON!" Somewhere around the island, the masterminds of the game, were laughing devilishly, as they watched the teams were currently boiled with anger and hurt pride. "They have no idea lmao.""
